# Porting Instructions

## Running the Porting Script

The `scripts/port-to-repo.ps1` script has been modified to work from the destination repository. To port files from your source repository, run:

```powershell
.\scripts\port-to-repo.ps1 -SourcePath "C:\path\to\source\repository" -DestinationPath "."
```

Replace `C:\path\to\source\repository` with the actual path to your source repository containing the sr-extract-orchestrator files.

## What Gets Ported

The script will copy:
- C# projects: `Il2CppMetadataDump` and `Orchestrator.Cli`
- PowerShell scripts: `dump.ps1`, `extract.ps1`, `import-dotenv.ps1`, `setup.ps1`
- Configuration files: `.env.example`, `Directory.Build.props`

## After Porting

1. Review `PORTING_NOTES.md` (generated by the script)
2. Check that `Directory.Build.props` doesn't conflict with existing build configuration
3. Verify `.env.example` contains all required variables
4. Test the setup script: `.\scripts\setup.ps1`
